#+TITLE: sops-mode

* About

Oh hey there. :) This is my first mode for Emacs, so it's personal.

* Install

The mode is still very infant, so please just clone the repository and load it
manually:

#+begin_src elisp
  (progn
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/repositories/gh/augustfengd/sops-mode")
    (require 'sops-mode))
#+end_src

* Usage

This is a minor mode that is loaded in json buffers. You can use the command:

  - ~sops-encrypt~ (~C-c C-c~) to create a buffer with the encrypted content of
    the current buffer
  - ~sops-decrypt~ (~C-c C-d~) to decrypt a buffer with the decrypted content of
    the current buffer

/hint/: You may set the decryption key using environment variables like so:

~M-x setenv~: ~SOPS_AGE_KEY~ _ENTER_ ~AGE-SECRET-KEY-1E0QSX7Y3X2QC4RNQATHWL48K3ZVQA7FLHXAPMFUK3G3U4PPTQ6NSDK995J~
